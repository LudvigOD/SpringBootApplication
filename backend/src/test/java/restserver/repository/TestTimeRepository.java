     * Ok, so here's my understanding of testing repositories:
     * - first off, we're not testing the interface itself, because that's just
     * Spring doing its magic
     * - but, we gotta make sure the stuff we think happens in the database,
     * actually does. I.e., "does this query even work?"
     * 
     * Why bother testing interfaces?
     * - Spring is doing a lot of magic for us, dynamically creating real
     * implementations of the repository interface, and we want to test that it
     * works as expected
     * - If we ever need to write custom queries (like SQL queries) we want to make
     * sure they actually fetch what we think they do
     * - Same for the named methods that automatically become queries (e.g.
     * findByStartNbr). We need test those that they work as expected. 'cause typos
     * and logic errors, they happen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
     * - plus, mapping entities to tables in the db requires that we use the same
     * names everywhere, so it's easy to mess up e.g. relations or column names
     * 
     * How it works?
     * - Apparently, we can use @DataJpaTest annotation to pretend we're talking to
     * a real db, but it's all in-memory and fast
     * - save some stuff, fetch it, see if it comes back right. If it does, we're
     * good!
